I"n<p>As an area of machine learning, supervised learning algorithms are the most basic and will be used to lay the groundwork for machine learning before we dive into the more complex area of reinforcement learning. As mentioned in \ref{SupervisedLearning}, supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data so that it can make accurate predictions on new unlabeled data. The two most basic supervised learning algorithms are linear regression, which is used for regression problems, and logistic regression, which is used for classification problems. Below is a diagram that outlines the basic process for using a supervised learning algorithm to solve a problem. First, a set of labeled data is fed into the machine learning algorithm, which then trains on the data to create a hypothesis $h$ that is able to make accurate predictions $y$ based on an input $x$.</p>
