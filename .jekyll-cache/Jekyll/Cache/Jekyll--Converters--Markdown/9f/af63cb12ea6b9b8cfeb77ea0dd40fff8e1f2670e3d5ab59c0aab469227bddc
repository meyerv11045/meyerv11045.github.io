I"<p>Machine learning is the subdomain of AI that powers many of the services we use today by using statistics to find patterns in massive sets of data \cite{ML_MIT}. Machine learning algorithms are used in numerous areas to find patterns in digital data because anything that can be stored digitally can be fed into a machine learning algorithm to get a prediction\cite{ML_MIT}. These predictions are utilized in the form of recommendations for music and media, voice commands on Siri and Alexa, and much more.</p>
