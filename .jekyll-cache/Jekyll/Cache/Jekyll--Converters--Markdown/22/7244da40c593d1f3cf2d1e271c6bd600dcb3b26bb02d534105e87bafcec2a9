I"‹<p>While linear regression makes continuous value predictions (e.g. any number between 0 and 100), logistic regression makes discrete predictions (e.g. $y$ is either 1 or 0). These discrete predictions can be used to classify inputs such as whether an email is spam or not spam or whether a tumor is malign or benign. In order to achieve this binary output, the hypothesis for linear regression must be slightly modified so that it maps all values of $\theta^TX$ to between 0 and 1 so that they can be treated as probabilities. This mapping is achieved using the sigmoid or logistic function ($\sigma(z)$) whose equation and graph is shown below.</p>
