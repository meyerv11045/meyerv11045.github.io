I"m<p>Machine learning is the subdomain of AI that powers many of the services we use today by using statistics to find patterns in massive sets of data \cite{ML_MIT}. Machine learning algorithms are used in numerous areas to find patterns in digital data because anything that can be stored digitally can be fed into a machine learning algorithm to get a prediction\cite{ML_MIT}. These predictions are utilized in the form of recommendations for music and media, voice commands on Siri and Alexa, and much more.</p>

<p>A formal definition of machine learning algorithms posed by researcher Tom Mitchell in 1998 is that a program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E \cite{WhatIsML}. To make this abstract definition more concrete, here is an example involving a machine learning algorithm that plays checkers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Experience E would be the program playing thousands of games of checkers.</li>
  <li>Task T is playing checkers.</li>
  <li>Performance measure P is the probability that it wins a game of checkers against a new opponent.</li>
</ul>

<p>This framework for defining a machine learning algorithm can be applied to any new problems that one hopes to solve with machine learning such as filtering spam emails or diagnosing cancer tumors.</p>
