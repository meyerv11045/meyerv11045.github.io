I"<p>As seen in the previous article, the definition of Artificial Intelligence is broad, so in order to more precisely identify the type of AI system, researchers have devised a classification system of narrow/weak, general/strong, and super intelligence \cite{AIvsMLvsDL}. These three classifications do not exist as buckets, but rather along a gradient with the most task specific AI on the narrow end of the spectrum and the AI overlords depicted in the movies on the super intelligent end of the spectrum.</p>
