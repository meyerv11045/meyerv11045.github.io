I"Ô<p>While in practice the difference between machine learning and deep learning can become blurred and the distinction can seem unimportant, when starting out it is easy to get overwhelmed with the all the new vocab that is used seemingly interchangeably. It is important to realize that these differences can be useful in understanding the broad field of artificial intelligence and choosing which subsections to focus on. As a beginner, it is important to not try and learn everything in artificial intelligence all at once because it is a complex field that takes years of practice to fully understand. That is why in the following technical document, we will give a brief overview of foundational machine learning concepts such as neural networks and different optimization techniques before we jump into an example of using one subsection of machine learningâ€“ reinforcement learning â€“to create an agent that wins at the game of pong by learning the game from scratch.</p>
