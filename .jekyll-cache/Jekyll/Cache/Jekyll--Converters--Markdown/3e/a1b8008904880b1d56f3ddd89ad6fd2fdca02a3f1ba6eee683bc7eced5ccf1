I"–<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is ‚Äúthe study and design of intelligent agents‚Äù where the intelligent agent perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chances of success \cite{AIDef}. This field of study was formalized starting in 1950 when Alan Turing wrote a paper discussing how to build intelligent machines and how to test their intelligence \cite{AIHistory}. While Turing laid the theoretical foundations for the field of AI, the high cost of computing at the time made it infeasible for him to create a proof of concept. 5 years later, in 1956, this proof of concept for an Artificially intelligent system was demonstrated at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, at which the name Artificial Intelligence was actually coined \cite{AIHistory}. In the decades following the seminal Dartmouth Summer Research Project, computers became cheaper and more accessible, allowing developments in the field of AI to flourish.</p>
