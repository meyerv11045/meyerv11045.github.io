While often used interchangeably, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are not synonymous. As seen in the figure above, machine learning is a subset of AI that is focused on creating systems that automatically learn from and improve from an experience without being explicitly programmed while AI is a broader category that involves other techniques to create a system that resembles human intelligence. Deep learning is a further subset of AI, one that expands on the neural networks used in machine learning by adding numerous hidden layers of computation to better find patterns (e.g. speech recognition by Amazonâ€™s Alexa) in large sets of data.
