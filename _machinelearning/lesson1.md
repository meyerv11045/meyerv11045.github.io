title: "What is Artificial Intelligence?"
lesson: 1

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is “the study and design of intelligent agents” where the intelligent agent perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chances of success \cite{AIDef}. This field of study was formalized starting in 1950 when Alan Turing wrote a paper discussing how to build intelligent machines and how to test their intelligence \cite{AIHistory}. While Turing laid the theoretical foundations for the field of AI, the high cost of computing at the time made it infeasible for him to create a proof of concept. 5 years later, in 1956, this proof of concept for an Artificially intelligent system was demonstrated at the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence, at which the name Artificial Intelligence was actually coined \cite{AIHistory}. In the decades following the seminal Dartmouth Summer Research Project, computers became cheaper and more accessible, allowing developments in the field of AI to flourish.

While early successes led to funding from agencies like DARPA, AI researchers soon ran into a tremendous obstacle that slowed the advancement of the field of AI-- computers of the 20th century simply did not have the memory or processing power required for large advancements in the field of AI \cite{AIHistory}. 

Fast forward a couple decades and now, in the 21st century, with the explosion of computer memory and processing power, the field of AI research has been able to truly boom. Computationally heavy areas such as deep learning combined with the emergence of big data has created a field that is revolutionizing the world as we know it. Artificial Intelligence has made its way into numerous industries-- personalized ads in marketing, fraud detection in banking, TV and movie recommendations in entertainment, and image diagnosis in healthcare to name a few of the numerous applications of AI. This modern AI boom has created a high demand for workers well versed in understanding and applying AI.
