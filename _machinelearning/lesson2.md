title: "Classifications of Artificial Intelligence"
lesson: 2

As seen in the previous article, the definition of Artificial Intelligence is broad, so in order to more precisely identify the type of AI system, researchers have devised a classification system of narrow/weak, general/strong, and super intelligence \cite{AIvsMLvsDL}. These three classifications do not exist as buckets, but rather along a gradient with the most task specific AI on the narrow end of the spectrum and the AI overlords depicted in the movies on the super intelligent end of the spectrum.

While these classifications are not often used in research, they are helpful in distinguishing between the AI killers of the movies and the real world AI systems that are a fraction of that power (e.g. IBMâ€™s Watson is still only classified as narrow AI due to its reliance on the data it is given and the task it is assigned by humans).
